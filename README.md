 🚀 Todo List App - My First JavaScript Project

Welcome to my **Todo List App**! This is my very first project while learning JavaScript, and I'm excited to share it with you. This app allows you to manage your tasks efficiently by adding, deleting, and organizing them into different categories: **All**, **Done**, and **Todo**.

## 🌟 Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your todo list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **Mark Tasks as Done**: Check off tasks to mark them as completed.
- **Filter Tasks**: View tasks based on their status using three buttons:
  - **All**: Show all tasks.
  - **Done**: Show only completed tasks.
  - **Todo**: Show only tasks that are not yet completed.
- **Dynamic Updates**: When you check or uncheck a task, it automatically moves between the "Done" and "Todo" sections.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Add a Task**:
   - Type your task in the input field and click the "Add" button.
   - The task will appear in the list under the "All" and "Todo" sections.

2. **Mark a Task as Done**:
   - Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed.
   - The task will move from the "Todo" section to the "Done" section.

3. **Delete a Task**:
   - Click the delete button (🗑️) next to a task to remove it from the list.

4. **Filter Tasks**:
   - Use the three buttons at the top to filter tasks:
     - **All**: Shows all tasks.
     - **Done**: Shows only completed tasks.
     - **Todo**: Shows only tasks that are not yet completed.

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Working with arrays and objects
- Dynamic updates to the UI
